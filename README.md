## Concept

- NFT holders can write options on their NFTs
- Option callers can purchase the options, at a given strike price, for given premium
- The option expires at a given time
- Our options are european, cash settled
- If the option expires 'in-the-money', the sequence goes as follows:
  - The NFT holder can provide the strike vs. market price difference to option caller, or
  - Option caller can receive the NFT at option's strike price, or
  - NFT is auctioned off
- If the option doesn't expire 'in the money', option premiums are distributed to NFT owners

## Product

- NFT owner writes an option on the NFT
- Protocol defines strike price and premium pricing options
  - Martket price oracles and bonding curves will be used
- NFT is staked for the option duration, in a pool with other NFTs OF THE SAME COLLECTION
  - At staking time, the NFT holder has the option to subscribe to option cover stream
    - The option cover stream continously balances the strike to market price differential for the owner
    - Ensuring the NFT owner doesn't loose the NFT or has to pay large lump-sum, on in-the-money option
    - Incentivizing NFT owner to provide their NFTs, improve liquidity and realize financial upside
- Protocol will automatically distribute the share of option premiums to NFT owners in the collection

## Business Potential

- Notional value of single stock options was over 10% higher than spot in 2021.
- This trend shows no sign of slowing crypto option platforms, such as LRA Opix and Z are growing.
- We see the same happening for NFTs, despite the bear, the top 10 NFT collections
  - Total over 2.5 million E in market cap
  - Over 3 million in daily trading on OPC alone
  - No team has succeeded yet in finding product market fit and gaining any significant traction.
- The financialization of NFTs is inevitable
